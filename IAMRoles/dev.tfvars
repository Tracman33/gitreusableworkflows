/*

But how can I make sure that my main is connected to these variable files in such a way that when i go into the dev directory i can do a terraform apply command and the infrastructure gets created in the dev enviroment same thing with production. I would really appreciate some more insight into this problem

Before this I tried to work with terraform workspaces however it uses the same backand for all enviroments which reduced the flexibility i needed`
